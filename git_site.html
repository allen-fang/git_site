					<h2>What is Git?</h2>
					<p>Git is a version contorl system; you can thinkn of it as a series of snapshots (comits) of your code base. With the creation of each asnapshot you build out a whole applicaiton, seeing the growth of a full app. During this time you can make branches to experienemtn and come back to a previous snapshots you took or merge those experiements into your app. </p>
					<h2>What is Github?</h2>
					<p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. Itlets you and others work toegheter on projects from anywhere using those code snapshots that you took during development.</p>

						<h3>Git init</h3>
						<p><span>Git init</span> is the act of registering this curent code base.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="c1">
						<h3>Git add</h3>
						<p><span>Git add</span> is hwo we stage the interagration of our current code ase into our current list of snapshots </p>
					</div>
					<div class="c1">
						<h3>Git status</h3>
						<p><span>Git statues</span> asllows us to see the changes we are going to make</p>
					</div>
					<div class="c2">
						<h3>Git Commit</h3>
						<p><span>Git commit</span>; finally we can commit those changes we added to our last snapcshot giving us a new snapshot of our code with whatever new changes were made</p>
					</div>
					<div class="c2">
						<h3>Git remote add</h3>
						<p><span>Git remote add</span> is used to set up a online repository where we can place all of our curernt code. This is where the outside world can see our code base.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="c3">
						<h3>Git push</h3>
						<p><span>Git push</span> is how we get our code to Github, an excellent place ot store all of our repositiories. Other developsers might look at our exisiting projects to see how we approached problems, pull down our code and add new features or even update our code base with features they wanted to add.</p>
